798. Smallest Rotation with Highest Score
DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
 Given an array A, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer K so that the array becomes A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1].  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point. 

For example, if we have [2, 4, 1, 3, 0], and we rotate by K = 2, it becomes [1, 3, 0, 2, 4].  This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.

Example 1:
Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation:  
Scores for each K are listed below: 
K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
K = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
K = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
K = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3
So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.

 

Example 2:
Input: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation:  A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
So we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.
Note:

A will have length at most 20000.
A[i] will be in the range [0, A.length].

class Solution {
public:
    int bestRotation(vector<int>& A) {
        int n=A.size();
        vector<int> change(n);
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) change[(i-A[i]+1+n)%n]--;
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) change[i]+=change[i-1]+1;
        return distance(change.begin(), max_element(change.begin(), change.end()));        
    }
};

How dosen score change when K++ ?

Get point
Each time when we rotate, we make index 0 to index N-1, then we get one more point.
We know that for sure, so I donâ€™t need to record it.

Lose point
(i - A[i] + N) % N is the value of K making A[i]'s index just equal to A[i].
For example, If A[6] = 1, then K = (6 - A[6]) % 6 = 5 making A[6] to index 1 of new array.
So when K=5, we get this point for A[6]
Then if K is bigger when K = (i - A[i] + 1) % N, we start to lose this point, making our score -= 1
All I have done is record the value of K for all A[i] where we will lose points.

A[i]=0
Rotation makes no change for it, becasue we alwars have 0 <= index.
However, it is covered in a) and b)

Explanation of codes

Search the index where score decrease and record this changement to a list change.
A simple for loop to calculate the score for every K value.
score[K] = score[K-1] + change[K]
In my codes I accumulated changes so I get the changed score for every K value compared to K=0
Find the index of best score.
