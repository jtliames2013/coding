In a social group, there are N people, with unique integer ids from 0 to N-1.

We have a list of logs, where each logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B] contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

 

Example 1:

Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], N = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.
 

Note:

2 <= N <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 10^4
0 <= logs[i][0] <= 10^9
0 <= logs[i][1], logs[i][2] <= N - 1
It's guaranteed that all timestamps in logs[i][0] are different.
logs are not necessarily ordered by some criteria.
logs[i][1] != logs[i][2]
