Sum of two bits can be obtained by performing XOR (^) of the two bits. Carry bit can be obtained by performing AND (&) of two bits. It is simple logic that can be used to add 2 single bits. We can extend this logic for integers. If x and y donâ€™t have set bits at same position(s), then bitwise XOR (^) of x and y gives the sum of x and y. To incorporate common set bits also, bitwise AND (&) is used. Bitwise AND of x and y gives all carry bits. We calculate (x & y) << 1 and add it to x ^ y to get the required result.

class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b!=0) {
            unsigned int carry=a&b;
            a^=b;
            b=carry<<1;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
