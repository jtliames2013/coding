Discuss   Editorial Solution Pick One
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
Example 1:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.

With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = id will have an overall balance bal[id]. Note that the id value or any person coincidentally with 0 balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, so we can simply use an array debt[] to store all non-zero balances, where

debt[i] > 0 means a person needs to pay $ debt[i] to other person(s);
debt[i] < 0 means a person needs to collect $ debt[i] back from other person(s).
Starting from first debt debt[0], we look for all other debts debt[i] (i>0) which have opposite sign to debt[0]. Then each such debt[i] can make one transaction debt[i] += debt[0] to clear the person with debt debt[0]. From now on, the person with debt debt[0] is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.

Note: Thanks to @KircheisHe who found the following great paper about the debt settling problem:

Settling Multiple Debts Efficiently: An Invitation to Computing Science by T. Verhoeff, June 2003.
The question can be transferred to a 3-partition problem, which is NP-Complete.

class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<long>& debt, int start, int cnt) {
        while (start<debt.size() && debt[start]==0) start++;
        if (start==debt.size()) {
            res=min(res, cnt);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i=start+1; i<debt.size(); i++) {
            if (debt[start]*debt[i]<0 && (i==start+1 || debt[i]!=debt[i-1])) {
                debt[i]+=debt[start];
                dfs(debt, start+1, cnt+1);
                debt[i]-=debt[start];
            }
        }
    }
    
    int minTransfers(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<int,long> bal;
        vector<long> debt;
        for (auto& t:transactions) {
            bal[t[0]]-=t[2];
            bal[t[1]]+=t[2];
        }
        for (auto& b:bal) if (b.second) debt.push_back(b.second);
        sort(debt.begin(), debt.end());

        res=INT_MAX;
        dfs(debt, 0, 0);
        return res;
