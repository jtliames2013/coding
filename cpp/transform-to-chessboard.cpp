782. Transform to Chessboard
DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
An N x N board contains only 0s and 1s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no 0s and no 1s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.

Examples:
Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:

0110     1010     1010
0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
1001     0101     1010
1001     0101     0101

The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.


Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
01
10

is also a valid chessboard.

Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.
Note:

board will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range [2, 30].
board[i][j] will be only 0s or 1s.

An observation is that, in a valid ChessBoard, any rectangle inside the board with corner NW, NE, SW, SE (NW here means north-west) must satisfy (NW xor NE) == (SW xor SE), where xor is exclusive or. Here we call it validness property.

Since the swap process does not break this property, for a given board to be valid, this property must hold. A corollary is that given a row, any other row must be identical to it or be its inverse. For example if there is a row 01010011 in the board, any other row must be either 01010011 or 10101100.

With this observation, we only need to consider the first column when weâ€™re swapping rows to match the ChessBoard condition. That is, it suffies to find the minimum row swap to make the first column be 010101...^T or 101010...^T. (here ^T means transpose.)

Similarly, it suffies to consider the first row when swapping columns.

Now the problem becomes solvable, with the following steps:

Check if the given board satisfy the validness property defined above.
Find minimum row swap to make the first column valid. If not possible, return -1.
Find minimum column swap to make the first row valid. If not possible, return -1.
Return the sum of step 2 and 3.
